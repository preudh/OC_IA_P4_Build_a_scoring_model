    "   - **Best ROC AUC**: `0.746318807175601`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forest**:\n",
    "   - The best parameters for both over-sampling and under-sampling are the same, suggesting that the model configuration is robust across different resampling strategies.\n",
    "   - The ROC AUC for under-sampling (0.7395) is higher than for over-sampling (0.7068), indicating that under-sampling might be a better strategy for the Random Forest model in this case.\n",
    "   - Using class weight adjustment in Random Forest shows an improvement in ROC AUC compared to over-sampling but still underperforms compared to under-sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ridge Classifier**:\n",
    "   - The best parameters for both over-sampling and under-sampling are the same.\n",
    "   - The ROC AUC values are very close for over-sampling (0.7457) and under-sampling (0.7446), indicating that both resampling strategies perform similarly well for the Ridge Classifier.\n",
    "   - Using class weight adjustment in Ridge Classifier gives a slightly better ROC AUC (0.7463), making it the best-performing method overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "The warnings you received:\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\pat\\.conda\\envs\\P4\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\linear_model\\_ridge.py:212: LinAlgWarning: Ill-conditioned matrix (rcond=7.51842e-18): result may not be accurate.\n",
    "  return linalg.solve(A, Xy, assume_a=\"pos\", overwrite_a=True).T\n",
    "\n",
    "C:\\Users\\pat\\.conda\\envs\\P4\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\linear_model\\_ridge.py:212: LinAlgWarning: Ill-conditioned matrix (rcond=6.55936e-17): result may not be accurate.\n",
    "  return linalg.solve(A, Xy, assume_a=\"pos\", overwrite_a=True).T\n",
    "```\n",
    "These warnings indicate that the Ridge regression encountered ill-conditioned matrices, which means that the matrix used in the ridge regression solver has very small singular values, causing potential numerical instability. This can happen when there are highly correlated features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addressing Ill-Conditioned Matrix Warnings**:\n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering**: Investigate and possibly remove or combine highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "   - **Regularization**: Consider using stronger regularization (increase the `alpha` parameter) to help stabilize the solution.\n",
    "   - **Scaling**: Ensure that the features are properly scaled, as Ridge regression can be sensitive to the scale of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Classifier**: Given the higher ROC AUC scores, the Ridge Classifier seems to perform better than the Random Forest in this case.\n",
    "   - **Resampling Strategy**: Both over-sampling and under-sampling show similar performance for the Ridge Classifier, but under-sampling performs better for Random Forest. You might choose the strategy based on other factors such as computational efficiency or interpretability."

    "### Observations and Insights\n",
    "1. **Model Performance**:\n",
    "   - The model performs exceptionally well in predicting non-defaulting clients (Class 0) but fails to predict defaulting clients (Class 1).\n",
    "   - The recall for defaulting clients is 0, indicating that the model did not identify any defaulting clients correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ROC AUC Score**:\n",
    "   - The ROC AUC score of 0.50 indicates that the model has no discriminative ability, performing no better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Imbalance Issue**:\n",
    "   - The classification report and confusion matrix highlight a significant class imbalance issue, where the model is biased towards the majority class (non-defaulting clients).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Need for Improvement**:\n",
    "   - The current model is inadequate for practical use in credit scoring due to its failure to identify defaulting clients.\n",
    "   - Resampling techniques (like SMOTE, under-sampling, and class weighting) or different models need to be explored further to address the imbalance and improve the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. **Reassess the Model**:\n",
    "   - Consider using more sophisticated techniques for handling class imbalance, such as SMOTE with Tomek links or ensemble methods like balanced random forests.\n",
    "   - Experiment with other classifiers that might handle imbalance better, such as XGBoost or LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Review and improve feature engineering to ensure relevant features are being used, which might help the model differentiate better between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Data**:\n",
    "   - Ensure data quality and consider additional preprocessing steps to handle any underlying issues that might be affecting model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on improving the handling of class imbalance and re-evaluating the features used, the model's ability to predict both defaulting and non-defaulting clients can be significantly enhanced."

    "\n",
    "### Cross-Validation\n",
    "A technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the dataset into multiple training and testing sets. This helps in understanding how the model will generalize to an independent dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GridSearchCV\n",
    "A tool from `scikit-learn` that performs hyperparameter tuning by exhaustively searching through a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model, using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "The process of finding the optimal values for hyperparameters of a model, which are parameters that are not learned from data but set before the learning process begins. Examples include the number of trees in a random forest or the regularization strength in Ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ROC AUC Score\n",
    "A performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC AUC represents the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate. A score closer to 1 indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "A table used to describe the performance of a classification model by showing the actual vs. predicted classifications. It includes True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report\n",
    "A detailed report showing the precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class in a classification problem. This helps in understanding the performance of the model across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling Techniques\n",
    "Methods used to adjust the class distribution of a dataset, commonly used to handle class imbalance. Examples include:\n",
    "- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Generates synthetic samples for the minority class.\n",
    "- **RandomUnderSampler**: Reduces the number of samples in the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline\n",
    "A tool from `scikit-learn` that allows for chaining multiple processing steps (e.g., data transformation and model fitting) into a single object. This ensures that all steps are applied consistently during both training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\n",
    "A method to explain individual predictions of machine learning models by assigning each feature an importance value. It helps in understanding how the model arrives at its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Explainer\n",
    "An object in the SHAP library that is used to calculate SHAP values for a given model. It helps in interpreting the contributions of each feature to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Values\n",
    "Values calculated by the SHAP explainer that quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction for a given instance. Higher absolute values indicate greater impact on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Summary Plot\n",
    "A plot that visualizes the global importance of features by showing the distribution of SHAP values for each feature across all instances in the dataset. It helps in understanding which features are most influential for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Force Plot\n",
    "A plot that provides a detailed breakdown of the contributions of each feature to a single instance's prediction, illustrating how different features push the prediction towards or away from the base value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest\n",
    "An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ridge Classifier\n",
    "A linear model for classification that includes L2 regularization (Ridge regression) to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
