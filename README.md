## Project Objective

The objective of this credit scoring project is to develop a predictive model that accurately assesses the likelihood of clients defaulting on their loans. The model must handle the class imbalance between good and bad clients and minimize the financial impact of prediction errors. Specifically, false negatives (bad clients predicted as good) carry a higher cost than false positives (good clients predicted as bad). The project involves creating a "business" score to compare model performance and selecting the optimal model and hyperparameters. Finally, the model must be interpretable to stakeholders and effectively documented.

### Steps and Recommendations

**Step 1: Exploratory Analysis**
- Understand project goals and select a relevant Kaggle kernel.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and create at least three new features.
- **Recommendations**: Use the kernel, add comments, check for missing values.
- **Resources**: Courses on data cleaning and feature engineering.

**Step 2: Define a Business Metric**
- Understand the cost of prediction errors in finance.
- Implement a cost function that weighs false negatives more heavily.
- **Recommendations**: Optimize hyperparameters using this cost function.
- **Resources**: Courses on evaluating model performance and creating business scores.

**Step 3: Model Optimization and Evaluation**
- Test different models and handle class imbalance.
- Use Cross-Validation and Grid Search for robust model evaluation.
- **Recommendations**: Compare models using AUC and accuracy.
- **Resources**: External resources on model benchmarking and the Imbalanced-learn library.

**Step 4: Model Interpretability**
- Use SHAP or LIME to calculate global and local feature importance.
- Provide explanations for model predictions.
- **Recommendations**: Document your findings clearly.
- **Resources**: SHAP and LIME documentation.

### Additional Notes
- Focus on minimizing the business cost by balancing false positives and false negatives.
- Maintain technical metrics like AUC and accuracy for comparison.
- Ensure your presentation is clear and your Jupyter notebook is well-documented.

### Tools and Environment Setup

To set up your working environment for this project, you can use the following tools:

1. **Anaconda Distribution**:
   - Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. It simplifies package management and deployment.
   - **Creating a Virtual Environment**:
     ```bash
     conda create -n credit_scoring_env python=3.8
     conda activate credit_scoring_env
     ```

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
   - **Starting Jupyter Notebook**:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

3. **Using Your Own IDE**:
   - You can use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VS Code to work on this project. Ensure that your IDE is configured to use the virtual environment created with Anaconda.

4. **Google Colab**:
   - Google Colab is a free cloud service that supports Jupyter notebooks. It provides free access to GPU and TPU for fast model training.
   - To use Google Colab, simply upload your notebook to Colab and start working. This is especially useful if you don't want to set up the environment locally.

These tools will help you efficiently manage your project environment, write and run your code, and document your work.
